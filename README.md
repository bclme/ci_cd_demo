<h1>A Simple GitHub CI/CD Demo</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In the world of software development, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) have become essential practices. They enable developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their code, resulting in faster development cycles and more reliable software. GitHub, one of the most popular version control platforms, provides robust support for CI/CD workflows through its GitHub Actions feature. In this article, we'll take a hands-on approach to explore CI/CD on GitHub by creating a simple Python project and setting up a GitHub Actions workflow.

<h3>About CI/CD</h3>

<p>Before we dive into the practical demonstration, let's briefly discuss what CI/CD is and why it's important. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It's a set of practices and tools that allow developers to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (Continuous Integration) and deploying those changes to production or other environments (Continuous Deployment). CI/CD promotes collaboration, reduces manual errors, and accelerates software delivery.
